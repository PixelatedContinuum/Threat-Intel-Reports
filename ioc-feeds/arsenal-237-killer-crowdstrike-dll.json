This variant uses identical BYOVD techniques and IOCTLs as killer.dll but with a reconfigured kill list specifically targeting CrowdStrike Falcon processes (CSFalconService.exe, csagent.exe, CSFalconContainer.exe). Discovered on Arsenal-237 open directory at IP 109.230.231.37, this Rust-compiled module demonstrates threat actor modularity and efficient retargeting of existing offensive tools.",
