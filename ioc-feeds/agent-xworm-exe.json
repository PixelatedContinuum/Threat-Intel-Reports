XWorm is a professional-grade .NET Remote Access Trojan operating as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) with global scale (18,459 devices compromised in single campaign). This sample features hardcoded C2 infrastructure, Base64-encoded communications, PowerShell execution capabilities, and modular plugin architecture. XWorm campaigns frequently deploy secondary payloads (78% multi-malware rate) including AsyncRAT and LockBit Black ransomware.",
