This malware establishes four redundant persistence mechanisms masquerading as Microsoft .NET Runtime components, drops a secondary payload (RuntimeOptimization.exe), and demonstrates sophisticated anti-forensics capabilities. Discovered on open directory at IP 109.230.231.37, this malware demonstrates professional development practices including watchdog threads, embedded payload deployment, thread injection capabilities, and cryptographic operations.",
