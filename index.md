# Threat-Intel-Reports

Welcome to my repository of threat hunting, malware analysis, and reverse engineering reports.  
The goal is to present findings from my own research and hunting that are actionable for detection engineering, threat hunting, and incident response teams.

---

## 🎯 Mission
- Share reproducible research and technical reports from my own research and hunting  
- Provide IOCs that can be used in threat hunting or detection engineering (Indicators of Compromise)  
- Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques to assist in making my findings as useful as possible  
- Publish detection logic for the threats in my reports (Sigma, YARA, Splunk, etc.)  
- Above all, enable community collaboration and knowledge transfer  

> **Note:** This is not a collection of open source intel reports, IOCs, or TTPs.  
> These findings are from my own research and hunting, though they may overlap with known threats.  
> If you are looking for an open source collection of intel, let me know — I can help point you there.

## 📝 Report Format
Each report follows a consistent structure: [Report Teamplate](/Report-Template)

### Executive Summary
High-level overview for quick triage.

### Technical Details
- File structure analysis (PE headers, offsets, payloads)  
- Reverse engineering notes (entry points, obfuscation, persistence)  
- Behavior observed (networking, privilege escalation, anti-analysis)  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping to observed behaviors  

### IOCs
| Type   | Value                   |
|--------|-------------------------|
| SHA256 | abc123...               |
| Domain | malicious-example[.]com |
| IP     | 192.168.1.50            |

### Detection Opportunities
- Sigma/YARA rules  
- Splunk/Elastic queries

## ⚡ Usage
- Import IOC feeds into your SIEM/EDR and threat hunting workflows  
- Adapt detection logic for your environment  
- Use ATT&CK mappings for threat modeling or attack simulation  
- Reference reverse engineering notes for deeper analysis  
- Import into your CTI platform of choice
