# Threat-Intel-Reports

Welcome to my repository of **threat hunting, malware analysis, and reverse engineering reports**.  
The goal is to present findings from my own research and hunting that are actionable for **detection engineering, threat hunting, and incident response** teams.

## 📌 Mission
- Share reproducible research and technical reports from my own research and hunting
- Provide **IOCs** that can be used in threat hunting or detection engineering (Indicators of Compromise)
- Map findings to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques to assist in making my findings as usful as possible
- Publish **detection logic** for the threats in my reports (Sigma, YARA, Splunk, etc.)
- Above all, I hope enable community collaboration and knowledge transfer
