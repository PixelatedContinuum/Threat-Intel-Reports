# Threat-Intel-Reports

Welcome to my repository of **threat hunting, malware analysis, and reverse engineering reports**.  
The goal is to present findings from my own research and hunting that are actionable for **detection engineering, threat hunting, and incident response** teams.

---

## Mission
- Share reproducible research and technical reports from my own research and hunting
- Provide **IOCs** that can be used in threat hunting or detection engineering (Indicators of Compromise)
- Map findings to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques to assist in making my findings as usful as possible
- Publish **detection logic** for the threats in my reports (Sigma, YARA, Splunk, etc.)
- Above all, I hope enable community collaboration and knowledge transfer
  
NOTE: This is not a collection of open source intel reports, IOCs, TTPs, etc. This will be from my own research and hunting but, may have some overlap from known threats. If you are looking for a open source collection of intel let me know! I can help there too.
