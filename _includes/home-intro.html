<div class="home-intro">
  <p>Welcome to my repository of threat hunting, malware analysis, and reverse engineering reports.</p>
  <p>The goal is to present findings from my own research and hunting that are actionable for detection engineering, threat hunting, and incident response teams. Feel free to contribute or just reach out with information, questions, or suggestions!</p>

  <h2>🎯 Mission</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Share reproducible research and technical reports from my own investigations and hunting</li>
    <li>Provide IOCs that can be used in threat hunting or detection engineering</li>
    <li>Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques to assist in making findings useful</li>
    <li>Publish detection logic for threats (Sigma, YARA, Splunk, etc.)</li>
    <li>Enable community collaboration and knowledge transfer</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a collection of open source intel reports. These findings are from my own research and hunting as well as others who contribute. If you’re looking for open source intel, I can help point you to sources or show you how to build your own!</p>

  <h2>📝 Report Format</h2>
  <p>Each report follows a consistent structure: <a href="/report-templates/">Report Templates</a></p>

  <h2>⚡ Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Import IOC feeds into your SIEM/EDR workflows</li>
    <li>Adapt detection logic or use for quick hunts</li>
    <li>Use ATT&CK mappings for threat modeling</li>
    <li>Reference reverse engineering notes for deeper analysis</li>
    <li>Import into your CTI platform of choice</li>
  </ul>
