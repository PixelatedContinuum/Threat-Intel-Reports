# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (BLUF)

## The Bottom Line

I have identified **six professionally-developed malware samples** distributed from an open web directory at **109.230.231.37**, representing a significant threat to organizations across all industries. This campaign combines remote access trojans (RATs), multi-layer persistence mechanisms, and credential theft capabilities in a coordinated threat ecosystem that demonstrates organized cybercrime operations.

>Analyst Note: The files themselves, naming, capabilities, distribution, and more make me think that this is a testing ground. From analyzing all the samples it strikes me as new tools or combinations of tools being developed or tested.

>I also want to point out that the 6 files focused on are not the only files found. There was a total of 38 files in this directory so I had to decide what to focus on and get some information out ASAP. I will continue to investigate the rest of the files and update here if there are any significant findings. 

**WHAT I FOUND:**
This analysis examined six representative malware samples selected from an open directory containing 30+ malicious executables. The samples include sophisticated remote access trojans (PoetRAT variant, Xworm RAT versions 1 and 2.4.0), advanced persistence droppers (FleetAgentAdvanced, FleetAgentFUD), and privilege escalation tools (UAC bypass proof-of-concept). All Xworm variants share the same command-and-control infrastructure (IP: 109.230.231.37), indicating centralized threat actor operations. The most concerning finding is FleetAgentAdvanced.exe, which implements **quadruple-redundant persistence** across Registry Run keys, Scheduled Tasks, and dual Startup folder shortcuts—designed to survive multiple cleanup attempts and ensure malware survival across system reboots.

**BUSINESS IMPACT IF INFECTED:**
Successful infection enables threat actors to establish persistent remote access to compromised systems, harvest credentials (browser passwords, saved authentication tokens, session cookies), exfiltrate sensitive business data, and use infected machines as pivot points for lateral movement across corporate networks. Organizations facing compromise should anticipate multi-day to multi-week incident response efforts requiring coordination across security, IT operations, legal, and compliance teams. Beyond the immediate technical compromise, organizations face:

- **Operational Disruption:** Credential theft and data exfiltration incidents typically require intensive multi-day investigation to determine breach scope, followed by extended remediation periods for credential rotation, system rebuilds, and security control deployment. Operational disruption severity varies based on compromise scope, ranging from isolated endpoint impacts to potential enterprise-wide service interruptions.

- **Compliance Obligations:** Data exfiltration triggers mandatory breach notification requirements under regulations like GDPR (72-hour reporting window), HIPAA (60-day notification for healthcare data), and state-level privacy laws (CCPA, SHIELD Act). Organizations must assess whether Protected Health Information (PHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or payment card data was compromised, potentially triggering customer notification obligations and regulatory scrutiny.

- **Reputational Impact:** Customer trust erosion following credential theft or data breach incidents results in measurable customer attrition, partner relationship strain, and competitive disadvantage in security-conscious markets. Organizations in regulated industries or those requiring security certifications may face procurement exclusions or contract compliance challenges.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **BLOCK CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:** Add IP address **109.230.231.37** to firewall deny lists, web proxy blocklists, and DNS sinkhole configurations. This single network indicator appears across all Xworm RAT variants analyzed and represents the highest-confidence blocking opportunity.

2. **DEPLOY DETECTION SIGNATURES:** Import provided YARA rules to endpoint detection platforms (EDR solutions, antivirus management consoles) and Sigma rules to SIEM platforms (Splunk, Elastic, Microsoft Sentinel). Detection packages are organized by malware sample with combined rulesets for rapid deployment. See [Hunting Detections]({{ "/hunting-detections/" | relative_url }}) section and individual report links in the Quick Reference Links below.

3. **HUNT FOR EXISTING INFECTIONS:** Execute threat hunting procedures targeting persistence artifacts (Registry Run keys with "WindowsDefenderUpdate" or "Microsoft .NET Runtime Optimization" names), suspicious scheduled tasks (Microsoft-themed task names executing from %AppData% locations), and network connections to 109.230.231.37. Detailed hunting queries provided in Quick Start Detection Guide below.

4. **VERIFY SYSTEM INTEGRITY (IF INFECTIONS FOUND):** Organizations identifying confirmed infections must prioritize complete system rebuilds over cleanup attempts. The quadruple-redundant persistence mechanisms in FleetAgentAdvanced and dual-layer persistence in agent.exe are specifically designed to survive partial remediation, increasing residual risk of incomplete cleanup. Detailed incident response procedures available in individual malware reports.

**RISK ASSESSMENT:**
- **CURRENT RISK (No Action):** **HIGH (7.8/10)** - Open directory distribution model enables widespread opportunistic infections; professional-grade persistence mechanisms ensure long-term system compromise; centralized C2 infrastructure facilitates coordinated threat actor operations.
- **RESIDUAL RISK (After Mitigation):** **LOW (2.3/10)** - Network blocking eliminates C2 connectivity for Xworm variants; detection signatures enable identification of infections before persistence establishment; threat hunting removes existing compromises; system hardening prevents reinfection.

**ASSESSMENT BASIS:**
This analysis represents comprehensive examination of six publication-quality malware reports selected from 30+ executables in the open directory. Analysis methodology combined static analysis, dynamic behavioral monitoring, memory forensics, and threat intelligence research correlating infrastructure indicators with known malware campaigns. All technical findings verified across multiple independent analysis tools; confidence levels documented in individual reports.

# Campaign Summary

Analysis of 6 representative samples from the open directory at **109.230.231.37** (containing 30+ malicious executables) reveals a sophisticated, multi-tier threat ecosystem combining professional remote access trojans (RATs), multi-layer persistence droppers, and proof-of-concept exploitation tools. The campaign demonstrates hallmarks of organized cybercrime operations: shared command & control infrastructure, diverse malware families coordinated through centralized infrastructure, and evasion-focused techniques including deceptive Microsoft-themed naming ("WinDefenderSvc.exe", "Microsoft .NET Runtime Optimization") designed to blend with legitimate system processes.

## Technical Sophistication Spectrum

Technical sophistication varies significantly—from the Golang-compiled PoetRAT variant with extensive cryptographic capabilities (AES, ChaCha20, RSA) and process injection potential to the lightweight 17KB FleetAgentFUD.exe leveraging WebSocket-based C2 with custom authentication headers. Xworm RAT variants demonstrate maturity with hardcoded C2 authentication tokens (AgentSec_8hJ3kL6mN9pQ2rS5tU8vW1xY4zA7bC0d), PowerShell-based reconnaissance, and **environment-aware activation** (dormancy mechanisms) designed to evade automated sandbox detection systems.

## Persistence Engineering Excellence

The most concerning finding is **FleetAgentAdvanced.exe**, implementing **quadruple-redundant persistence**:

1. **Registry Run Key:** `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Microsoft .NET Runtime Optimization`
2. **Scheduled Task:** `\Microsoft\Windows\.NET Runtime Optimization` executing at user logon
3. **Startup Folder LNK (User Profile):** `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\Microsoft .NET Runtime Optimization.lnk`
4. **Startup Folder LNK (Common Startup):** Duplicate shortcut in alternate Startup directory

All four mechanisms deployed within 1.3 seconds, demonstrating automated deployment. The malware immediately deleted the scheduled task XML configuration file after creation, hampering forensic analysis—an anti-forensic behavior indicating threat actors anticipating security response.

## Network Infrastructure Patterns

Network analysis reveals all Xworm variants share the same C2 server (**109.230.231.37**), suggesting centralized threat actor infrastructure despite varied malware families. This infrastructure consolidation provides defenders with a high-value blocking opportunity—a single network indicator that neutralizes multiple malware families simultaneously. Dynamic analysis identified active persistence establishment in agent.exe and FleetAgentAdvanced.exe, while other samples exhibited dormant behavior—likely awaiting specific environmental conditions, time triggers, or successful C2 handshakes before activating full capabilities.

>Analyst Note: This was one of the many strong indicators to me that this is being used as a testing ground for development. In other cases I have done, there has been extensive obfuscation of C2 address through dynamic assignments from past bin site lists, encryption, and other methods. Here we just see a sometimes hardcoded and static C2 address.

# Additional Analysis: AutomatedReports Overview

Beyond the 6 comprehensive threat intelligence reports, **32 additional malware samples** from the same open directory received automated static analysis through my custom built StaticTriage framework. These samples represent the broader threat ecosystem and provide context for the distribution infrastructure.

## Sample Categories

**Agent RAT Variants** (8 samples):
- agent_anycpu.exe, agent_dotnet.exe, agent_dotnet_slim.exe, agent_dotnet_v2.exe, agent_dotnet_v3.exe, agent_fw.exe, agent_fw_x64.exe, agent_mem_x64.exe
- **Common Characteristics:** .NET-compiled RAT variants with DNS capabilities, mutex implementations, and varying compilation targets (AnyCPU, x86, x64, memory-only execution)
- **Threat Level:** MEDIUM to HIGH - Same RAT family as comprehensive agent.exe analysis but different compilation configurations

**FleetAgent Suite** (6 samples):
- FleetAgent_MemoryOnly.exe, FleetAgentAdvanced.exe, FleetAgentAdvanced_embedded.exe, FleetAgentEDR.exe, FleetAgentFUD.exe, FleetAgentFull.exe
- **Common Characteristics:** Professional malware-as-a-service suite with specialized variants for different evasion scenarios (memory-only, EDR evasion, fully-undetectable builds)
- **Threat Level:** HIGH to CRITICAL - Demonstrates threat actor toolkit diversity and operational maturity

**Encryption/Decryption Utilities** (8 samples):
- dec.exe, dec_fast.exe, dec_pc3.exe, dec_unique.exe, enc.exe, enc_pervictim.exe, enc_v2.exe, updated_enc.exe
- **Common Characteristics:** Ransomware components or file encryption utilities with varying encryption schemes (per-victim keys, updated algorithms, optimized decryptors)
- **Threat Level:** CRITICAL - Suggests ransomware deployment capability or victim data encryption for extortion

**Test/Development Tools** (4 samples):
- test_decryptor.exe, test_gui_enc_v2.exe, test_nopass.exe, test_pass.exe
- **Common Characteristics:** Testing utilities for encryption/decryption functionality, likely part of threat actor development/QA process
- **Threat Level:** LOW - Development artifacts, not weaponized malware

**XWorm RAT Variants** (2 samples):
- agent_xworm.exe, agent_xworm_v2.exe
- **Analysis:** Covered in comprehensive threat intelligence reports (see [agent-xworm-exe.md](agent-xworm-exe.md) and [agent-xworm-v2-exe.md](agent-xworm-v2-exe.md))
- **Threat Level:** HIGH - Active C2 infrastructure, PowerShell execution, multi-malware deployment

**Specialized Utilities** (4 samples):
- ProtonVPN.exe, steal_browser.exe, uac_test.exe, agent.exe
- **ProtonVPN.exe:** Legitimate VPN client or bundled/trojanized version (requires behavioral analysis for confirmation)
- **steal_browser.exe** (8.09 MB): Large credential theft tool with extensive anti-analysis capabilities (debugger detection, VM detection, PowerShell integration)
- **uac_test.exe:** UAC bypass proof-of-concept (covered in comprehensive report uac-test-exe.md)
- **Threat Level:** VARIABLE - steal_browser.exe is CRITICAL for credential theft, ProtonVPN requires context, uac_test.exe is LOW risk

## Key Findings from AutomatedReports

**Infrastructure Insight:** The presence of 32+ samples demonstrates this is not a single-purpose distribution point but a **comprehensive threat actor toolkit repository**. The diversity of malware families (RAT variants, ransomware components, credential stealers, testing tools) suggests:
- **Organized cybercrime operations** with mature development processes (test builds, versioned releases)
- **Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infrastructure** offering multiple tools for different attack scenarios
- **Threat actor versatility** - Same infrastructure hosts initial access tools (RATs), privilege escalation (UAC bypass), credential theft (steal_browser), and impact tools (encryption utilities)

**Detection Priority:** While the 6 comprehensive reports cover the highest-priority active threats, organizations should remain vigilant for the broader sample set. Automated detection signatures (YARA, file hashes) for all 32 samples are available in the detection packages.

>**Automated Analysis:** All 32 samples underwent my custom made StaticTriage automated analysis. Full reports will be made available as manual analysis of the data is done and if there are any high impact findings to note. 

>If anyone would like the raw data from these 32 samples after my automated static triage workflow was completed for further investigation let me know on LinkedIn, find my profile in the about me section.

## Host-Based Indicators

**File System Artifacts:**
```
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\WinDefenderSvc.exe
%LocalAppData%\Temp\.wd_installed
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\CLR\RuntimeOptimization.exe
%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\Microsoft .NET Runtime Optimization.lnk
```

**Registry Persistence Mechanisms:**
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WindowsDefenderUpdate
  Malware: agent.exe (PoetRAT variant)

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Microsoft .NET Runtime Optimization
  Malware: FleetAgentAdvanced.exe
```

**Scheduled Tasks:**
```
Task Name: Microsoft\Windows\.NET Runtime Optimization
Action:    Execute RuntimeOptimization.exe from %AppData%\Microsoft\CLR\
Trigger:   At user logon
Malware:   FleetAgentAdvanced.exe
```

**Process Indicators:**
```
agent.exe → WinDefenderSvc.exe (dropped payload)
agent_xworm.exe → powershell.exe (reconnaissance)
agent_xworm_v2.exe (WebSocket connections)
FleetAgentAdvanced.exe → schtasks.exe (persistence creation)
FleetAgentFUD.exe → powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass
```

## Behavioral Indicators

**Deceptive Naming Patterns:**
- Processes masquerading as Microsoft services: "WinDefenderSvc.exe", "Microsoft .NET Runtime Optimization"
- Executables in user directories (%AppData%, Startup folders) with system-themed names
- Non-Microsoft-signed binaries claiming Windows Defender or .NET Framework affiliation

**Rapid Persistence Deployment:**
- All 4 FleetAgentAdvanced persistence mechanisms created within 1.3 seconds
- Immediate task.xml deletion after scheduled task creation (anti-forensics)
- Dual persistence in agent.exe (Registry Run + Startup folder) deployed simultaneously

**PowerShell Execution Patterns:**
```powershell
# Reconnaissance Commands
Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id, Path
Get-Service | Select-Object Name, Status, StartType
(Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain
```

# Strategic Implications

This campaign demonstrates several concerning trends in contemporary threat landscapes:

**1. Commoditization of Advanced Capabilities:** Remote access trojan functionality, WebSocket-based C2 protocols, and multi-layer persistence mechanisms are now accessible via open directories, dramatically lowering barriers to entry for less sophisticated threat actors.

**2. Shared Infrastructure Patterns:** Multiple distinct malware families sharing C2 infrastructure (109.230.231.37) suggests centralized threat operations or malware-as-a-service (MaaS) business models. Infrastructure-based blocking provides outsized defensive value—a single network indicator neutralizes multiple threat families simultaneously.

**3. Evasion-First Design Philosophy:** Deceptive Microsoft-themed naming conventions, anti-forensic behaviors (immediate task.xml deletion), and environment-aware dormancy mechanisms indicate threat actors prioritizing stealth and long-term persistence over immediate impact.

**4. Persistence Engineering Excellence:** FleetAgentAdvanced's quadruple-redundant persistence architecture demonstrates threat actors anticipating partial remediation efforts and designing survival mechanisms accordingly. Complete system rebuild recommended over incremental cleanup for HIGH-risk malware.

## Sample Selection Methodology

From the 30+ executables in the open directory, six representative samples were selected for comprehensive analysis based on:
1. Malware family diversity (PoetRAT, Xworm RAT, FleetAgent variants)
2. Capability variation (RATs, persistence droppers, privilege escalation tools)
3. Risk categorization (CRITICAL, HIGH, and LOW risk samples)
4. Technical sophistication (professional-grade to proof-of-concept)

## Quality Assurance

**Multi-Stage Validation:**
- Static analysis → Dynamic analysis → Memory forensics (three independent analysis methodologies)
- Cross-tool verification: IOCs validated across YARA, CAPA, Volatility, Autoruns, PEStudio
- Behavioral timeline verification: Process trees from Volatility 3 matched against Procmon execution logs
- Detection signature testing: YARA rules tested against samples (100% detection) + clean systems (zero false positives)

---

**Important Notes:**
- The presence of malware samples in an open directory does not imply the hosting provider's awareness or complicity
- IP address 109.230.231.37 should be blocked via firewall rules, but network operators should verify legitimate use cases before implementing blocks
- Detection signatures may require tuning for specific environments to minimize false positives
- Organizations discovering infections should consult with qualified incident response professionals before remediation
- This analysis represents findings as of January 2026; threat actors may modify infrastructure, update malware capabilities, or change tactics over time
