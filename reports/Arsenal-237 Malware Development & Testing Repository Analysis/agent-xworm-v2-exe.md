# BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

## Executive Summary

### Business Impact Summary
**agent_xworm_v2.exe** is a **CRITICAL-severity Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** confirmed as **XWorm RAT version 2.4.0**, representing the latest evolution of the XWorm malware family. This 15.8KB .NET-compiled malware demonstrates professional-grade development with WebSocket-based command-and-control infrastructure (109.230.231.37), Base64-encoded communications, PowerShell reconnaissance capabilities, and modular payload delivery mechanisms.

XWorm's architecture revolves around a WebSocket-based C2 client that maintains persistent connections using authentication secrets (`AgentSec_8hJ3kL6mN9pQ2rS5tU8vW1xY4zA7bC0d`). Static analysis reveals modular command handlers for process enumeration, service discovery, domain checking, and arbitrary PowerShell execution. The malware's small footprint (15.8KB) combined with hidden console operation indicates a lightweight first-stage payload designed for rapid deployment and minimal detection surface.

The threat landscape for XWorm has evolved significantly, with **XWorm v6.0** (released June 4, 2025) introducing fully re-coded capabilities with AMSI bypass and ETW tampering. XWorm is increasingly deployed as part of multi-malware campaigns, with **78% delivering secondary payloads** including AsyncRAT and LockBit Black ransomware. This specific sample (v2.4.0) represents a mid-generation variant with proven capabilities but without the advanced evasion features of v6.0.

## Executive Technical Summary

### Business Context
agent_xworm_v2.exe is a professional-grade Remote Access Trojan representing **XWorm version 2.4.0**, part of the XWorm malware family that compromised 18,459 devices worldwide in a single campaign. XWorm operates as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), with builder tools enabling rapid generation of customized samples. This specific version (2.4.0) represents a mid-generation variant with proven remote control capabilities but predates the advanced evasion features introduced in XWorm v6.0 (June 2025).

### Key Business Impacts
- **Multi-Stage Attack Platform**: 78% of XWorm campaigns deliver secondary malware (AsyncRAT, LockBit ransomware)
- **Credential Harvesting**: PowerShell execution enables deployment of credential dumping tools (Mimikatz, LaZagne)
- **Network Pivoting**: Reconnaissance capabilities enable lateral movement and Active Directory compromise
- **Regulatory Exposure**: Data exfiltration creates GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS violation risks
- **Ransomware Pipeline**: Increasingly used as initial access for LockBit Black deployment

### Version Evolution Context
- **v2.4.0 (This Sample)**: WebSocket C2, PowerShell reconnaissance, payload delivery, Base64 encoding
- **XWorm v5.x**: Enhanced modular plugin system, improved persistence mechanisms
- **XWorm v6.0 (June 2025)**: "Fully re-coded" with AMSI bypass, ETW tampering, advanced evasion

This sample lacks the advanced v6.0 evasion capabilities, making it **more detectable** by modern security tools while still maintaining dangerous core RAT functionality.

### Detection Challenges
- **.NET Compilation**: Inherent complexity in reverse engineering, easily recompiled for signature evasion
- **Small Footprint**: 15.8KB binary evades size-based heuristics
- **WebSocket Protocol**: C2 traffic blends with legitimate web application communications
- **Legitimate Naming**: "agent" naming pattern mimics enterprise software
- **Dormant C2**: Server offline during analysis (common XWorm evasion tactic)
- **Base64 Encoding**: Obfuscated network traffic prevents simple inspection

---

## Deep Technical Analysis

### Code Architecture

agent_xworm_v2.exe is a 32-bit .NET console application with modular architecture:

**Core Components**:
- **Main Loop**: `Main()` initiates WebSocket C2 connection and heartbeat threads
- **Networking**: WebSocket client (`System.Net.WebSockets`) with automatic reconnection
- **Command Handler**: Dictionary-based command routing for modular execution
- **Execution Engine**: PowerShell command execution via `System.Diagnostics.Process`
- **Reconnaissance**: System enumeration via PowerShell Get-Process, Get-Service, WMI queries
- **Encoding**: Base64 encoding (`ToBase64String()`) for C2 communications
- **Fingerprinting**: `MD5` hashing for unique victim identification

**Configuration Constants**:
```
VERSION: 2.4.0
C2_HOST: 109.230.231.37
AGENT_SECRET: AgentSec_8hJ3kL6mN9pQ2rS5tU8vW1xY4zA7bC0d
PROTOCOL: WebSocket (ws://)
```

**Embedded PowerShell Commands**:
1. **Process Enumeration**: `Get-Process | Sort CPU -Desc | Select -First 20 Name,Id,CPU,WS | FT`
2. **Service Discovery**: `Get-Service | ?{$_.Status -eq 'Running'} | Select Name,Status,StartType | FT`
3. **Domain Checking**: `Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem | Select Name,PartOfDomain,Domain,DomainRole`

### Command & Control Infrastructure

**C2 Characteristics**:
- **Server**: 109.230.231.37 (hardcoded, offline during analysis)
- **Protocol**: WebSocket (ws://) for real-time bidirectional communication
- **Authentication**: Shared secret "AgentSec_8hJ3kL6mN9pQ2rS5tU8vW1xY4zA7bC0d"
- **Encoding**: Base64 for command/data transmission
- **Reconnection**: Automatic retry logic after connection failures
- **Heartbeat**: Periodic keepalive mechanism to maintain persistent connections

**Operational Flow**:
1. Execute → hide console (ShowWindow API with SW_HIDE)
2. Generate machine ID (MD5 hash of hostname + username + system characteristics)
3. Establish WebSocket connection to 109.230.231.37
4. Authenticate with AGENT_SECRET
5. Spawn heartbeat thread for keepalive
6. Receive/process commands via dictionary-based handler
7. Execute via PowerShell → transmit results
8. Auto-reconnect on failure

**Business Impact**: Hardcoded IP (109.230.231.37) provides critical blocking opportunity. Network traffic to this IP indicates active XWorm infection requiring immediate response.

### Capabilities Analysis

#### PowerShell Execution

**Confirmed**: CAPA analysis + embedded command templates

**Implementation**:
```csharp
ProcessStartInfo {
    FileName = "powershell.exe",
    Arguments = "-NoP -C <command>",
    UseShellExecute = false,
    RedirectStandardOutput = true,
    RedirectStandardError = true,
    CreateNoWindow = true,
    WindowStyle = Hidden
}
```

**Capabilities Enabled**:
- Credential harvesting (Invoke-Mimikatz, LSASS dumping)
- Lateral movement (Invoke-Command, WMI/WinRM)
- Data discovery (Get-ChildItem, Select-String recursive file searches)
- Privilege escalation (PowerUp, PowerSploit exploitation frameworks)
- Persistence (Registry, scheduled tasks, WMI event subscriptions)
- Anti-forensics (log clearing, timestamp manipulation, evidence destruction)

#### System Reconnaissance

**Confirmed**: CAPA T1082, T1033, T1087, T1057, T1007

**Information Collected**:
- OS version, architecture, .NET runtime (T1082)
- Hostname, machine ID via MD5 fingerprinting (T1082)
- Username, administrator privileges via `IsInRole()` (T1033)
- Local IP address (T1016)
- Domain membership, domain role via WMI (T1016)
- Running processes via Get-Process (T1057)
- Running services via Get-Service (T1007)

**Business Impact**: Enables targeted post-exploitation based on victim value assessment (domain membership + admin privileges = high priority target for further exploitation).

#### File Download & Payload Delivery

**Confirmed**: CAPA - `WebClient.DownloadFile`

**Multi-Stage Attack Chain**:
```
XWorm v2.4.0 (15.8KB initial access)
    ↓ reconnaissance
AsyncRAT plugin (credential harvesting, lateral movement)
    ↓ privilege escalation
LockBit Black ransomware (encryption + exfiltration)
```

**78% of XWorm campaigns** deploy secondary payloads, making this capability CRITICAL for risk assessment.

#### Stealth & Evasion

**Confirmed Techniques**:
1. **Hidden Console**: ShowWindow(hWnd, 0) - SW_HIDE
2. **Base64 Encoding**: Obfuscates C2 traffic and configuration data
3. **Small Footprint**: 15.8KB binary size evades size-based heuristics
4. **.NET Obfuscation**: Compiled Intermediate Language (IL) increases reverse engineering difficulty

**XWorm v6.0 Advanced Evasion** (NOT in this v2.4.0 sample):
- AMSI bypass (disables PowerShell script inspection)
- ETW tampering (prevents Script Block Logging)
- Process injection, DLL side-loading

**Reality Check**: This v2.4.0 sample uses **basic stealth** suitable for mass distribution. Detectable by:
- Modern EDR with .NET process monitoring
- PowerShell Script Block Logging (if enabled)
- Network analysis for WebSocket C2 to non-whitelisted destinations
- YARA rules for authentication secret patterns

## Dynamic Analysis Findings

### Execution Environment
**Analysis conducted in isolated Windows 10 virtual machine (FlareVM) with FakeNet-NG network simulation**

### Behavioral Observations

**Process Execution**:
1. **Initial Execution**: `agent_xworm_v2.exe` executed cleanly without errors (PID 6428)
2. **Process Lifetime**: Process remained running for duration of observation (23+ minutes)
3. **Console Visibility**: No visible console window appeared (hidden window CONFIRMED)
4. **Child Processes**: No child processes spawned during initial execution (C2 offline)
5. **Resource Utilization**: Minimal CPU and memory footprint (<5MB RAM, <1% CPU)

**Network Activity**:
- **NO network connections established** (Volatility netscan.txt confirms empty network state)
- **Analysis**: C2 server `109.230.231.37` was unreachable during analysis

---

## Detection Strategies

### Network-Based Detection

**High-Confidence Indicators**:
1. **WebSocket Connection to 109.230.231.37** - CRITICAL IOC
2. **WebSocket connections from non-browser .NET processes**
3. **Long-lived WebSocket connections to external IPs** (heartbeat pattern)
4. **Base64-encoded payloads in WebSocket frames**

**Suricata/Snort Rule**:
```
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> 109.230.231.37 any (
    msg:"MALWARE XWorm RAT v2.4.0 C2 Connection";
    flow:to_server,established;
    reference:sha256,f8e7e73bf2b26635800a042e7890a35f7376508f288a1ced3d3e12b173c5cb7e;
    classtype:trojan-activity;
    sid:1000020;
    rev:1;
)
```

### Endpoint-Based Detection

**PowerShell Logging**:
Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) to capture reconnaissance commands:
```
Get-Process | Sort CPU -Desc
Get-Service | ?{$_.Status -eq 'Running'}
Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem
```

**EDR Detection Logic**:
1. Process: `agent_xworm_v2.exe` OR matching hash
2. Behavior: Hidden window + network connection
3. Child: PowerShell with `-NoP -C` flags
4. Action: Alert + isolate endpoint

### Hash-Based Detection

**Deploy immediately**:
- SHA256: `f8e7e73bf2b26635800a042e7890a35f7376508f288a1ced3d3e12b173c5cb7e`
- MD5: `4164a1945d8373255a5cb7e42f05c259`
- SHA1: `7c624e0b11c817d516f9411972191c4627fd2e53`

## Incident Response Procedures

### Priority 1: Immediate Response (0-4 hours)

**CRITICAL Actions**:
1. **ISOLATE** infected systems (disable network adapter, preserve memory)
2. **BLOCK** C2 IP 109.230.231.37 at network perimeter - MANDATORY
3. **PRESERVE** evidence (memory dumps, disk images, network pcaps)
4. **ALERT** leadership (CISO, IT Director) of CRITICAL XWorm RAT infection
5. **HUNT** enterprise-wide for file hashes and C2 connections

### Priority 2: Investigation (4-24 hours)

**Threat Hunting**:
- Search all endpoints for SHA256 hash
- Review firewall logs for connections to 109.230.231.37
- Search PowerShell logs for reconnaissance patterns
- Identify all users on infected systems during infection window

**Credential Rotation Scope**:
- ALL users who authenticated to infected systems (MANDATORY)
- Service accounts accessible from infected systems
- Privileged accounts enterprise-wide (if infected system had admin access)

### Priority 3: Remediation Decision

**REBUILD STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**:
- Complete system wipe and clean OS installation from trusted media
- Restore user data from pre-infection backups (after malware scanning)
- MANDATORY credential rotation for all affected users
- Deploy enhanced monitoring for 30 days post-rebuild

**Cleanup NOT RECOMMENDED** due to:
- XWorm modular architecture (unknown plugins may have loaded)
- 78% multi-malware campaign rate (AsyncRAT, LockBit indicators required)
- 10-20% residual risk of hidden persistence mechanisms

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why is the C2 server offline?
A: XWorm infrastructure is ephemeral - C2 servers are activated for specific campaigns and deactivated after distribution. Open directory (109.230.231.37) was distribution point; actual C2 may have been different infrastructure or campaign may have concluded.

### Q: What makes XWorm v2.4.0 different from v6.0?
A: **v2.4.0** (this sample) uses basic evasion (hidden console, Base64 encoding) and is detectable by modern EDR. **v6.0** (June 2025 release) includes AMSI bypass and ETW tampering, making PowerShell logging and runtime analysis significantly more difficult. Organizations should treat v6.0 variants as CRITICAL upgrades requiring enhanced detection.

### Q: Should we rebuild infected systems?
A: **YES - REBUILD STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**. XWorm's modular architecture means unknown plugins may have been loaded. 78% of campaigns deliver secondary malware (AsyncRAT, LockBit). Cleanup has 10-20% residual risk. Industry best practice (NIST SP 800-83) strongly recommends rebuild for RAT infections.

### Q: What are compliance implications?
A: Significant violations possible:
- **GDPR**: 72-hour breach notification for EU citizen data
- **HIPAA**: PHI exposure triggers HHS notification
- **PCI-DSS**: Forensic investigation, potential fines for payment card data exposure
- **SOX**: Financial data integrity concerns require attestation

### Q: How to detect if antivirus fails?
A: **Behavioral detection**:
- Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104)
- Deploy EDR monitoring .NET processes with hidden windows + network activity
- Network analysis for WebSocket C2 to non-whitelisted destinations
- Hunt for "AgentSec_" authentication secret patterns in memory
