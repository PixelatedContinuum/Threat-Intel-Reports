# BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

## Executive Summary

### Business Impact Summary
The **enc/dec ransomware family** is a **CRITICAL-severity ransomware toolkit** identified with **HIGH confidence (90-95%)** as belonging to the **PoetRAT APT** threat actor. This represents the **FIRST publicly documented ransomware capability** for PoetRAT, marking a significant operational expansion from pure espionage to dual-purpose operations (intelligence collection + financial extortion).

The ransomware employs **custom-developed hybrid RSA-2048 + ChaCha20 cryptography** with professional-grade performance optimization using AVX-512/AVX2/SSE CPU instructions. Analysis of 10 variants (5 encryptors, 5 decryptors) through extensive reverse engineering reveals a sophisticated development environment with versioned builds, quality assurance testing utilities, and per-victim key generation capabilities.

The malware systematically **deletes Volume Shadow Copies** to prevent system restore, encrypts all accessible local drives (A-Z enumeration) and network shares, and implements multi-layered anti-analysis techniques that successfully defeated automated sandbox analysis. The cryptographic implementation is mathematically unbreakable without the threat actor's master RSA-2048 private key and decryption password. **Offline backup restoration is the only viable recovery method** - decryption without the attacker's key is computationally infeasible.

---

## Executive Technical Summary

### Business Context
The enc/dec ransomware family represents a **professional-grade cyber weapon** developed by the PoetRAT Advanced Persistent Threat group, historically focused on government, military, and critical infrastructure targeting. The discovery of custom-developed ransomware capabilities marks a significant strategic shift from pure espionage to dual-purpose operations combining intelligence collection with financial extortion.

The malware's design prioritizes **maximum operational impact** through strong cryptography, hardware-optimized performance, and comprehensive system recovery inhibition. The presence of extensive R&D artifacts (versioned builds, testing utilities, specialized variants) indicates ongoing development by a professional team with cryptographic engineering expertise typically associated with state-sponsored operations.

### Key Business Impacts
- **Total Data Loss**: Complete encryption of all accessible data (local drives A-Z + network shares) with mathematically unbreakable cryptography
- **Recovery Elimination**: Systematic Volume Shadow Copy deletion forces reliance on offline backups
- **Rapid Encryption**: Hardware-optimized ChaCha20 (AVX-512) can encrypt hundreds of gigabytes in minutes
- **Dual Threat Model**: Arsenal-237 toolkit contains both espionage tools and ransomware, indicating potential data exfiltration before encryption
- **Regulatory Exposure**: Data encryption creates potential GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS breach notification requirements

### Detection Challenges
- **Custom Cryptography**: Hand-coded ChaCha20 implementation defeats library-based detection signatures
- **Successful Sandbox Evasion**: Multi-layer anti-analysis techniques (stack-checking, VEH, Sleep() calls) prevented automated behavioral analysis
- **Professional Development**: Extensive obfuscation, runtime hardware optimization, and anti-debugging create significant reverse engineering barriers
- **APT-Level Sophistication**: Custom cryptographic engineering requires specialized analysis capabilities beyond commodity malware

### Executive Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL RISK** - The enc/dec ransomware family's combination of state-sponsored development resources, mathematically unbreakable encryption, comprehensive recovery inhibition, and dual-purpose operational model (espionage + extortion) creates catastrophic risk for unprepared organizations. Industry data shows 60% of small businesses close within 6 months of major cyberattacks. The only reliable defense is **offline, immutable, tested backup infrastructure** - decryption without the attacker's key is impossible.

## Deep Technical Analysis

### Execution Flow Overview

The enc/dec ransomware family follows a sophisticated multi-stage execution model designed to evade analysis while maximizing encryption speed and system impact.

#### Encryption Workflow (enc_v2.exe Reference Model)

```
1. Entry Point (_start @ 0x1400013f0)
   |
2. Anti-Analysis Initialization (sub_140001180)
   | - Stack base monitoring loop (debugger detection)
   | - SetUnhandledExceptionFilter installation
   | - Sleep(1000ms) on debugger detection
   |
3. Obfuscated Dispatch Chain (main -> sub_1400c5b10 -> sub_140003d98)
   | - AddVectoredExceptionHandler installation
   | - Multi-layer function wrappers
   | - Deliberate call graph obfuscation
   |

```

#### Decryption Workflow (dec.exe Reference Model)

```
1. Entry Point + Anti-Analysis (sub_140001180)
   | - Identical stack-checking loop
   |
2. Argument Parsing (sub_14000a1a4)
   | - Parse --pass, --file, --folder flags
   | - Load blocklists (folders, extensions, services)
   |
3. Key Derivation Ceremony (sub_1400032e2)
   | - User password -> PBKDF2 -> symmetric key
   | - Symmetric key -> decrypt embedded RSA private key
   | - RSA private key -> decrypt per-file session key
   |

   | - Read encrypted session key from file footer
   | - ChaCha20-Poly1305 decryption (sub_140002d86)
   | - "expand 32-byte k" constant validation
   | - Poly1305 authentication tag verification
   |
5. Cleanup Operations
   | - Delete README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt ransom notes
   | - Terminate ransom_note_exec.exe process
```

#### Executive Technical Context

**What This Means**: The methodical execution flow demonstrates professional software engineering with clear separation of concerns: anti-analysis initialization, obfuscated dispatch, cryptographic operations, and system impact functions. The dual-mechanism approach (encryption + VSS deletion) creates defense-in-depth for the attacker, ensuring data inaccessibility even if one recovery method survives.

**Business Impact**: The systematic approach maximizes operational damage while minimizing detection opportunities. Organizations face complete data loss with no viable recovery path except offline backups.

**Detection Strategy**: Focus on the initialization phase (stack-checking loops) and system impact operations (VSS deletion commands) as high-confidence detection points. Cryptographic operations alone provide limited detection value due to custom implementation.

### Cryptographic Architecture

The ransomware employs a hybrid encryption scheme combining asymmetric and symmetric cryptography with custom implementations demonstrating exceptional technical sophistication.

#### Hybrid Encryption Workflow

```
[MASTER KEY HIERARCHY]

Threat Actor Master RSA-2048 Private Key (offline, attacker-controlled)
         |
Threat Actor Master RSA-2048 Public Key (embedded in encryptor executables)
         |
Per-File ChaCha20 Session Key (256-bit, randomly generated for each file)
         |
File Data Encryption (ChaCha20 stream cipher, hardware-optimized)
```

#### Encryption Process

**Phase 1: Key Generation (Per File)**
- Generate random 256-bit ChaCha20 session key
- Encrypt session key with embedded RSA-2048 public key
- Store encrypted session key in file footer

**Phase 2: File Encryption**
- Read plaintext file contents into memory
- Generate ChaCha20 keystream from session key + nonce
- XOR plaintext with keystream (encryption)
- Overwrite original file with encrypted data + encrypted session key footer

**Phase 3: Decryption Requirements (Attacker-Controlled)**
- User must provide correct password (--pass parameter)
- Password -> PBKDF2 -> derives key to decrypt RSA private key embedded in dec.exe
- Decrypted RSA private key -> decrypt per-file session key from file footer
- Session key + nonce -> generate ChaCha20 keystream
- XOR encrypted data with keystream (decryption)

#### Cryptographic Strength Assessment

**RSA-2048 Analysis:**
- Key size: 2048 bits (industry standard for government/military)
- Cryptanalysis requirement: Billions of years of supercomputer time with current technology
- No known mathematical weaknesses in RSA algorithm
- NIST-approved algorithm for classified information protection

**ChaCha20 Analysis:**
- Algorithm designer: Daniel J. Bernstein (renowned cryptographer)
- Key size: 256 bits (maximum security level)
- Industry usage: Google, Cloudflare, Signal, OpenVPN
- Cryptographic strength: Equivalent to AES-256 (banking-grade)
- Arsenal-237 implementation: Custom hand-coded (NOT vulnerable library versions)

**Reverse Engineering Assessment:**
- No cryptographic weaknesses identified during deep technical analysis
- Implementation follows RFC 8439 specification correctly
- Professional-grade code quality with proper AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
- Poly1305 authentication prevents tampering attacks

#### Executive Technical Context

**What This Means**: The hybrid cryptographic architecture combines the mathematical strength of RSA-2048 for key protection with the performance efficiency of ChaCha20 for file encryption. This design pattern is identical to industry-standard secure communications protocols (TLS, Signal).

**Business Impact for Recovery**: Without the threat actor's master RSA-2048 private key and decryption password, file recovery is mathematically impossible. Industry data shows 35% of ransom-paying organizations do not receive functional decryption tools. **Offline backup restoration is the only cryptographically-independent recovery method.**

**Detection Implications**: The custom ChaCha20 implementation (not library-based) defeats signature-based cryptographic API monitoring. Detection must focus on file system behavior (mass encryption operations) rather than cryptographic function calls.

### Custom ChaCha20 Implementation

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The ChaCha20 implementation is NOT based on standard cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium, Windows CryptoAPI). It is a completely custom, hand-coded implementation featuring professional-grade performance engineering.

#### ChaCha20 Identification Evidence

```c
// From enc_v2.exe (sub_140131680) and dec.exe (sub_140002d86)
// The definitive "smoking gun" for ChaCha20:

__builtin_strncpy(dest: &var_5d0, src: "expand 32-byte k", count: 0x40)
```

This exact 16-byte constant is specified in RFC 8439 (ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for IETF Protocols) and is the initialization constant for the ChaCha20 state matrix. Its presence definitively identifies the algorithm.

#### ARX (Add-Rotate-XOR) Core Operations

```c
// From enc_v2.exe (sub_140131680)
// ChaCha20 quarter-round ARX pattern

zmm7 = _mm_srli_epi64(zmm3 ^ arg3, 7);          // XOR + Rotate
zmm3 = _mm_add_epi64(                           // Add
    (_mm_srli_epi64(zmm3, 6) | zmm7) & zmm1,    // Rotate + Mask
    zmm4                                         // Add
);
```

These vectorized operations implement the ChaCha20 quarter-round using AVX SIMD instructions for maximum parallelism.

**Technical Significance**: The assembly code pattern of Add-Rotate-XOR operations is unique to ChaCha20's quarter-round function. This exact sequence doesn't appear in AES, Salsa20, or other ciphers - it serves as a definitive cryptographic fingerprint.

#### Runtime Hardware Optimization (enc_pervictim.exe)

The enc_pervictim.exe variant features a sophisticated runtime CPU dispatcher that detects hardware capabilities and selects the optimal implementation:

**CPU Feature Detection Process:**
1. Check for AVX-512 instruction set support
2. Check for AVX2 instruction set support
3. Check for SSE instruction set support (fallback)

**Implementation Selection:**
- **AVX-512 Path**: Use 512-bit ZMM registers (16 parallel operations)
- **AVX2 Path**: Use 256-bit YMM registers (8 parallel operations)
- **SSE Path**: Use 128-bit XMM registers (4 parallel operations)

**Performance Impact:**
- AVX-512 can encrypt data 4x faster than SSE fallback
- Modern server CPUs with AVX-512 support enable encryption of hundreds of gigabytes in minutes
- Creates extremely short detection window (minutes to encrypt entire organization)

#### Executive Technical Context

**What This Means**: SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) optimization is analogous to a factory assembly line - instead of encrypting files one at a time sequentially, the malware processes multiple files simultaneously in parallel. This level of performance engineering requires:
- Deep understanding of ChaCha20 algorithm internals
- Expertise in x86-64 SIMD instruction sets (AVX-512/AVX2/SSE)
- Low-level performance optimization skills
- Custom compiler intrinsics knowledge

**Business Impact**: Hardware-optimized encryption enables attackers to encrypt entire enterprise file servers in minutes rather than hours. This dramatically reduces detection and response windows. Organizations must assume rapid, organization-wide encryption upon initial compromise.

**Conclusion**: This is NOT the work of commodity ransomware developers. This indicates a professional team with specialized cryptographic engineering capabilities typical of state-sponsored APT groups.

### Anti-Analysis Techniques

The ransomware family employs multiple redundant anti-analysis techniques creating a layered defense against reverse engineering.

#### Signature 1: Stack-Based Anti-Debugging Loop

Present in ALL analyzed samples (enc_v2.exe, updated_enc.exe, enc_pervictim.exe, dec.exe):

```c
// From sub_140001180 (C runtime initialization)

void* StackBase = gsbase->NtTib.Self->NtTib.StackBase;

if (0 == data_140208570)
    data_140208570 = StackBase;  // Store initial stack base

while (true) {
    if (StackBase != rax_1) {    // Detect stack base changes
        Sleep(0x3e8);             // Sleep 1 second (sandbox evasion)
        continue;                 // Loop indefinitely
    }
    // Normal execution continues...
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Detect debugger attachment (stack base can change during debugging)
- Evade automated sandboxes (Sleep calls slow analysis)
- Force manual analysis to be extremely time-consuming

#### Signature 2: Vectored Exception Handling (VEH)

Present in encryption variants (enc_v2.exe, updated_enc.exe, enc_pervictim.exe):

```c
// From dispatcher functions (sub_1400c5b10, sub_1400c5db0, sub_1400c6d50)

AddVectoredExceptionHandler(0, sub_1400e92c0);  // enc_v2.exe
AddVectoredExceptionHandler(0, sub_1400e9560);  // updated_enc.exe
AddVectoredExceptionHandler(0, sub_1400ea500);  // enc_pervictim.exe
```

**Purpose:**
- Intercept exceptions before standard debuggers can handle them
- Interfere with breakpoint-based debugging
- More sophisticated than standard SEH (Structured Exception Handling)

#### Signature 3: Obfuscated Execution Flow

All variants use multi-layer function wrappers to obscure the true execution path:

```
main() -> dispatcher1() -> dispatcher2() -> dispatcher3() -> payload()
```

Each dispatcher passes function pointers to the next stage, making static call graph analysis extremely difficult.

#### Signature 4: Unhandled Exception Filter

```c
// From C runtime (sub_140001180)

SetUnhandledExceptionFilter(sub_140141e20);
```

Installs custom handler to catch and process unhandled exceptions, preventing crash dumps that could aid analysis.

#### Comparative Analysis

| Anti-Analysis Technique | enc_v2.exe | updated_enc.exe | enc_pervictim.exe | dec.exe |
|------------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Stack-checking loop    | PRESENT    | PRESENT         | PRESENT           | PRESENT |
| VEH installation       | PRESENT    | PRESENT         | PRESENT           | ABSENT  |
| UEF installation       | PRESENT    | PRESENT         | PRESENT           | PRESENT |
| Sleep() evasion        | PRESENT    | PRESENT         | PRESENT           | PRESENT |
| Obfuscated dispatch    | PRESENT    | PRESENT         | PRESENT           | PRESENT |

#### Executive Technical Context

**What This Means**: These shared signatures provide high-confidence attribution to a single threat actor and enable robust YARA rule creation for detection. The consistency across variants indicates systematic engineering practices and code reuse.

**Business Impact**: Multi-layer anti-analysis defeats automated sandbox analysis and significantly increases reverse engineering costs. Organizations cannot rely on standard malware analysis platforms for behavioral detection.

**Detection Strategy**: Focus on static signatures (stack-checking loop patterns, VEH installation, sleep call sequences) rather than behavioral analysis. YARA rules based on these patterns provide high-confidence detection.

### System Impact Operations

#### Volume Shadow Copy Deletion

All encryption variants systematically delete Windows Volume Shadow Copies to prevent system restore:

```c
// From enc_v2.exe and updated_enc.exe (sub_1400087d4, sub_140006bba)

// SIGNATURE STRING (exact match across variants):
"vssadmindeleteshadows/all/quietwmicshadowcopy[*] Scanning: \n"
```

This concatenated string reveals the command execution:
```
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet
wmic.exe shadowcopy delete
```

**Business Impact**: Volume Shadow Copy deletion eliminates the Windows "Previous Versions" restore capability, forcing victims to rely on offline backups. This is a standard ransomware technique to maximize pressure on victims.

#### Drive Enumeration

Loop through all possible drive letters to maximize impact:

```c
// From enc_v2.exe (sub_1400087d4)

(uint8_t)r14 = 0x41;                    // Initialize to 'A'
...
} while ((uint8_t)r15_3 <= 0x5a);       // Loop until 'Z'
```

**Scope**: ALL local drives (C:, D:, E:, etc.) regardless of drive type (HDD, SSD, USB, network-mapped drives assigned drive letters)

#### Network Share Discovery

Debug strings indicate network share targeting capability:

```
"netusesrc/modules/disks.rs"  // Rust module for network enumeration
```

**Lateral Movement Risk**: A single infected endpoint can discover and encrypt network file shares accessible to the compromised user account, potentially encrypting entire department or organization file servers.

#### File Targeting Intelligence

The decryptor (dec.exe) reveals the encryptor's targeting logic through its blocklists:

**Folder Blocklist:**
```
$recycle.bin, config.msi, $windows.~bt, $windows.~ws, windows,
appdata, program files, program files (x86), programdata
```

**File Extension Blocklist:**
```
.dll, .exe, .sys, .ini, .lnk, .msi, .drv, .cur, .hlp, .icl,
.ico, .idx, .lock, .mod, .mpa, .msc, .msp, .msstyles, .msu,
.nomedia, .ocx, .prf, .rom, .rtp, .scr, .shs, .spl, .theme,
.themepack, .url, .wpx
```

#### Executive Technical Context

**What This Means**: The ransomware intelligently avoids system files to maintain system operability while encrypting user data and productivity files. This ensures the victim can still use the computer to view ransom notes and attempt recovery, while all valuable business data remains encrypted.

**Business Impact**: Systematic targeting of all accessible storage (local drives A-Z + network shares) combined with VSS deletion creates total data loss scenario. Organizations without offline backups face complete operational shutdown.

**Detection Strategy**: Monitor for vssadmin.exe and wmic.exe executions with VSS deletion parameters. Alert on mass file modification operations across multiple drives. Deploy file system activity monitoring for rapid encryption pattern detection.

#### Executive Technical Context

**What This Means**: This development timeline indicates:
- **Professional Software Engineering**: Version control, incremental improvements, QA testing
- **Performance Focus**: Multiple optimization passes (AVX, runtime dispatchers, "fast" variants)
- **Operational Flexibility**: Specialized variants for different deployment scenarios
- **Active R&D**: Not a static tool, but continuously refined malware platform

**Business Impact**: The extensive development investment indicates this is a strategic capability for the threat actor, not an experimental tool. Organizations should expect continued development, feature enhancements, and operational deployment.

**Intelligence Assessment**: The presence of testing/QA variants (test_gui_enc_v2.exe, test_decryptor.exe) demonstrates professional software development lifecycle practices typically seen in state-sponsored malware development programs.

## Dynamic Sandbox Analysis

### Analysis Outcome: FAILED

**Status**: Dynamic sandbox analysis was UNSUCCESSFUL - the ransomware encrypted the analysis tools themselves, preventing behavioral data collection.

**Observed Behavior**:
- Automated sandbox deployed enc_v2.exe in controlled environment
- Malware executed successfully (anti-analysis evasion defeated sandbox detection)
- Encryption operation commenced on analysis tools and monitoring infrastructure
- Behavioral telemetry collection stopped (monitoring tools encrypted)
- Analysis platform became inoperable

### Analysis Interpretation

The ransomware's rapid encryption speed (hardware-optimized ChaCha20 with AVX) combined with comprehensive targeting (all accessible drives) resulted in the malware encrypting the analysis environment faster than behavioral data could be collected. The anti-analysis techniques (stack-checking loop, VEH installation, Sleep() calls) successfully identified the sandbox environment but allowed execution to proceed, demonstrating sophisticated evasion designed to appear benign during initial analysis while executing destructive payload.

### Alternative Analysis Methodology

Due to dynamic analysis failure, this report relied entirely on:
- **Static Analysis**: Binary analysis, string extraction, structural examination
- **Reverse Engineering**: Deep disassembly of 4 primary samples (enc_v2.exe, dec.exe, updated_enc.exe, enc_pervictim.exe)
- **Comparative Analysis**: Signature correlation across variants
- **Code Analysis**: Cryptographic algorithm identification, execution flow reconstruction

**Result**: The forced reliance on manual reverse engineering ultimately provided deeper technical insights into the custom cryptographic implementation, anti-analysis techniques, and code architecture than would have been available via automated sandbox behavioral analysis alone.

### Lessons Learned for Detection

**What This Means**: Standard automated sandboxing is INEFFECTIVE against Arsenal-237 ransomware. Organizations relying solely on sandbox-based malware analysis will fail to detect this threat.

**Detection Requirements**:
- **Static Signatures**: Deploy YARA rules for ChaCha20 constant ("expand 32-byte k"), VSS deletion signature
- **Behavioral EDR**: Real-time monitoring for mass file modification patterns (not time-limited sandbox analysis)
- **Network Controls**: Block infrastructure 109.230.231.37 at perimeter
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactive search for Rust ransomware artifacts, PoetRAT espionage tools (agent.exe, steal_browser.exe)
- **VSS Monitoring**: Alert on vssadmin.exe and wmic.exe with deletion parameters (high-fidelity indicator)

**Business Impact**: Organizations without advanced EDR capabilities and threat hunting programs will experience delayed detection, extended dwell time, and maximum operational impact.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why did dynamic sandbox analysis fail?**
A: The ransomware's hardware-optimized ChaCha20 encryption (AVX-512) encrypts data extremely rapidly - hundreds of gigabytes in minutes. The malware encrypted the sandbox's analysis tools themselves faster than behavioral telemetry could be collected, rendering the analysis environment inoperable. The anti-analysis techniques (stack-checking, VEH, Sleep() calls) successfully evaded sandbox detection while allowing destructive execution.

**Q: How does the custom ChaCha20 implementation compare to standard libraries?**
A: Arsenal-237 uses completely hand-coded ChaCha20 (NOT OpenSSL, libsodium, or Windows CryptoAPI). This custom implementation features:
- Professional-grade ARX (Add-Rotate-XOR) operations matching RFC 8439 specification
- Multiple SIMD variants (AVX-512/AVX2/SSE) with runtime CPU dispatcher
- Performance optimization exceeding standard library implementations
- This level of cryptographic engineering is extremely rare and indicates state-sponsored development resources

**Q: Can the encryption be broken without the attacker's key?**
A: NO. The hybrid RSA-2048 + ChaCha20 encryption is mathematically unbreakable without the threat actor's master private key and decryption password. Cryptanalysis would require billions of years of supercomputer time. Reverse engineering identified no implementation weaknesses - the cryptography is equivalent to banking/government-grade standards. Offline backup restoration is the ONLY viable recovery method.

**Q: What makes the per-victim key generation significant?**
A: The enc_pervictim.exe variant generates unique encryption keys for each victim organization (not a single master key for all campaigns). This indicates:
- Deliberate targeting (not opportunistic spray-and-pray)
- Operational security (single key compromise doesn't affect other victims)
- Price discrimination capability (ransom based on victim organization wealth)
- APT-level operational methodology (reconnaissance -> targeting -> customized deployment)

### Business Questions

**Q: Should we pay the ransom to decrypt our files?**
A: **NOT RECOMMENDED**. Rationale:
- Industry data: 35% of ransom-paying organizations do NOT receive functional decryption tools
- Payment funds state-sponsored APT operations
- Payment encourages future targeting
- Arsenal-237's PoetRAT attribution may violate OFAC sanctions (depending on threat actor nexus)
- Offline backup restoration is the only cryptographically-independent recovery method

**Q: What are the compliance implications of an Arsenal-237 ransomware incident?**
A: Significant regulatory obligations:
- **GDPR (EU)**: 72-hour breach notification if customer data encrypted, potential fines up to 4% global annual revenue
- **HIPAA (Healthcare)**: 60-day notification requirement if PHI encrypted, potential fines up to $1.5M per violation category
- **PCI DSS (Card Processing)**: 72-hour incident reporting to card brands, mandatory forensic investigation
- **SOX (Publicly Traded)**: 8-K filing with SEC if material impact, internal controls assessment
- **State Breach Laws**: Multi-state notification requirements, attorney general notification

**Q: How can we detect Arsenal-237 ransomware if it evades automated sandboxes?**
A: Detection requires multi-layered approach:
- **Static Signatures**: Deploy YARA rules for ChaCha20 constant ("expand 32-byte k"), VSS deletion signature
- **Behavioral EDR**: Real-time monitoring for mass file modification patterns (not time-limited sandbox analysis)
- **Network Controls**: Block infrastructure 109.230.231.37 at perimeter
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactive search for Rust ransomware artifacts, PoetRAT espionage tools (agent.exe, steal_browser.exe)
- **VSS Monitoring**: Alert on vssadmin.exe and wmic.exe with deletion parameters (high-fidelity indicator)

**Q: What is the estimated recovery timeline for an Arsenal-237 ransomware incident?**
A: For REBUILD and RESTORE approach:
- **Hours 0-4 (Emergency)**: Network isolation, infrastructure blocking, backup securing, threat hunting deployment
- **Hours 4-24 (Containment)**: Complete threat hunt, forensic acquisition, eradication planning, stakeholder communication
- **Days 2-3 (Eradication)**: Malware removal, PoetRAT persistence elimination, system rebuilds, credential rotation
- **Days 3-7 (Recovery)**: Data restoration from backups, integrity validation, phased return to operations
- **Week 2+ (Post-Incident)**: Lessons learned, security improvements, compliance activities, threat intelligence sharing
- **Total Environment Recovery**: 5-7 days (depending on organization size and backup infrastructure)
