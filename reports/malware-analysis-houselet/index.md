# Go-based Stealer / Loader / RAT  

**Analyst:** Joseph Harrison  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Environment:** Windows 10 x64 (Userland / Kernel interaction observed)  
**Classification:** Go-based Stealer / Loader / Remote Access Trojan (RAT)

## 1. Executive Summary
houselet.exe is a Go 1.15-compiled 64-bit Windows binary that masquerades as the PlayStation Remote Play installer. The sample is characterized by multiple layers of obfuscation, dynamic loading, and in-memory execution, aligning it with modular loader-stealer families such as STEALC or derivative Go-based frameworks. It primarily operates from the user's temporary directory, communicates with a remote PHP-based C2 endpoint, and modifies registry/network configurations to maintain persistence and evade detection.

- .rdata → Go runtime metadata / strings  
- .data → Global variables  
- .pdata → Exception directory  
- .xdata → Unwind metadata  
- .idata → Import table  
- .reloc → Relocations  
- .symtab → Symbol table with Go names  
- .rsrc → Installer resources / icons

## 4. Static Analysis
### 4.1 Capability Detection
- Network: UDP/TCP sockets, DNS queries  
- System Access: Registry read/write, token manipulation, file ops  
- Privilege Management: Escalates/impersonates tokens  
- Anti-Analysis: Anti-VM checks, TLS allocation  
- Installer Stub: May unpack/drop payloads  

### 4.2 Cryptographic & Encoding Routines
- Base64 (326 matches)  
- XOR (18 matches)  
- AES (4 matches)  
- RC4/Salsa20/ChaCha20 detected  
- Hashing: FNV (20), Murmur3 (5)  

### 4.3 Embedded Go Modules
Recovered paths: sunless/anesthetist/*.go, sunless/main.go  
Functions: anesthetist.Nonprobableproagrarian, anesthetist.OverdevotedlyFrederick, etc. → in-memory decryption and RWX allocation.

### 4.4 In-Memory Execution Evidence
- Calls to VirtualAlloc, VirtualProtect  
- Nested goroutines for payload staging  
- Thread-safe memory ops via sync.Mutex, sync.Once  
- Synthetic structs in .rdata as decoys  

### 4.5 System & OS-Level Functions
- os.Executable, os.getModuleFileName  
- syscall.NewLazyDLL, LazyProc.Call  
- Reflective DLL loading and privilege manipulation  

### 4.6 Go Runtime Behavior
- Threads & Goroutines: runtime.mstart, runtime.main  
- Synchronization: sync/once, sync/mutex  
- String processing: unicode/utf8, encoding/binary

## 5. Dynamic Analysis (Any.Run Sandbox)
### 5.1 Execution Chain
- Parent: explorer.exe  
- Child: houselet.exe (self-spawned)  
- Path: %TEMP%\houselet.exe  
- Detection Label: STEALC variant  

### 5.2 Registry & Config Mods
- Alters IE settings (cache, proxy bypass)  
- Adds ZoneMap entry under HKCU  

### 5.3 Network Communication
- HTTP POST → http://45.155.69[.]25/b8380e89dabaee4a.php  
- Destination: 45.155.69[.]25:80  
- Purpose: Exfiltration / C2  

### 5.4 System Reconnaissance
- Queries computer name, locale, IE settings  

### 5.5 Memory & Thread Activity
- Multiple goroutines for concurrent tasks  
- RWX memory allocations  
- Hidden threads via sync.Once  

### 5.6 Observed Artifacts
- Executable: %TEMP%\houselet.exe  
- Network IP: 45.155.69[.]25  
- C2 Endpoint: /b8380e89dabaee4a.php  
- Certificate: Untrusted/self-signed

## 6. Behavioral Summary
- Execution: Runs from Temp, self-spawns, registry persistence  
- Memory Loading: Decrypts payloads into RWX pages  
- Network: HTTP POST to C2, exfiltrates data  
- Registry Mods: Alters IE ZoneMap/proxy keys  
- Privilege Ops: Token manipulation  
- Evasion: Anti-VM, fake Sony metadata  
- Crypto: Base64, AES, RC4, ChaCha  
- Concurrency: Nested goroutines  

---

## 8. Threat Assessment
- Objective: Data exfiltration / secondary payload deployment  
- Capabilities: In-memory execution, encrypted C2, registry manipulation, anti-VM  
- Family: STEALC or related Go-based RAT/loader  
- Impact: High  

---

## 9. Mitigation & Detection Recommendations
1. Block outbound traffic to 45.155.69[.]25:80  
2. Monitor executions from Temp/AppData named houselet.exe  
3. Inspect registry for IE ZoneMap/proxy changes  
4. Deploy YARA rules for sunless/anesthetist strings  
5. Detect high-entropy Go binaries with Sony metadata  
6. SIEM filters for HTTP POST to PHP paths without User-Agent  
7. Isolate hosts, collect memory dumps  

---

## 10. Conclusion
houselet.exe is a sophisticated Go-based loader/stealer employing in-memory payload deployment, encrypted C2 communication, and environment-aware evasion. Its combination of fake installer disguise, registry persistence, HTTP POST exfiltration, and runtime function obfuscation (via the sunless/anesthetist package) marks it as an evolving threat in the Go malware landscape.
