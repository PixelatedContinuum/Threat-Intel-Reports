title: Welcome to The Hunter’s Ledger

Welcome to my repository of threat hunting, malware analysis, and reverse engineering reports.  
The goal is to present findings from my own research and hunting that are actionable for detection engineering, threat hunting, and incident response teams. Feel free to contribute or just reach out with information, questions, or suggestions!

## 🎯 Mission
- Share reproducible research and technical reports from my own investigations and hunting  
- Provide IOCs that can be used in threat hunting or detection engineering  
- Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques to assist in making findings as useful as possible  
- Publish detection logic for the threats in my reports where possible (Sigma, YARA, Splunk, etc.)  
- Enable community collaboration and knowledge transfer so everyone is safer

## 📂 Repository Structure
- [Reports](/reports/) → Detailed malware analysis and reverse engineering notes.  
- [Hunting Detections](/hunting-detections/) → Sigma/YARA rules and detection logic.  
- [IOC Feeds](/ioc-feeds/) → Indicators of Compromise in JSON/CSV feeds.  
- [Report Templates](/report-templates/) → Consistent format for reports.

## ⚡ Usage
- Import IOC feeds into your SIEM/EDR workflows  
- Adapt detection logic for your environment  
- Use ATT&CK mappings for threat modeling  
- Reference reverse engineering notes for deeper analysis  
- Import into your CTI platform of choice  

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Fork the repo and submit a PR, or reach out to collaborate.
