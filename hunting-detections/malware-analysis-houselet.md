## Execution Layer

### Suspicious Process Execution from Temp
This rule looks for executions of `houselet.exe` from the Temp directory, which is highly unusual for legitimate software.
```
title: houselet.exe Execution from Temp
logsource:
  category: process_creation
detection:
  selection:
    Image|contains: "\AppData\Local\Temp\houselet.exe"
condition: selection
level: high
```

### Suspicious Self-Spawn Behavior
Malware often respawns itself to evade termination. This rule detects houselet.exe spawning itself with explorer.exe as parent.
```
title: Self-Spawned houselet.exe
logsource:
  category: process_creation
detection:
  selection:
    ParentImage|endswith: "explorer.exe"
    Image|endswith: "houselet.exe"
condition: selection
level: high
```

## Persistence Layer

### Registry Modification for IE ZoneMap
Houselet modifies Internet Explorer ZoneMap keys to bypass restrictions. This rule flags suspicious registry changes.
```
title: IE ZoneMap Registry Modification
logsource:
  category: registry
detection:
  selection:
    TargetObject|contains: "HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ZoneMap"
condition: selection
level: medium
```

### Registry Modification for Proxy Settings
The malware alters proxy settings to hide traffic. This rule detects changes to proxy-related registry keys.
```
title: Proxy Registry Modification
logsource:
  category: registry
detection:
  selection:
    TargetObject|contains: "HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Proxy"
condition: selection
level: medium
```

## Network Layer

### Suspicious HTTP POST to PHP Endpoint
Legitimate installers rarely POST to PHP scripts. This rule detects outbound POST requests to PHP endpoints.
```
title: HTTP POST to PHP C2
logsource:
  category: proxy
detection:
  selection:
    uri|endswith: ".php"
    http.method: "POST"
condition: selection
level: high
```

### Outbound Traffic to Known C2 IP
This rule directly monitors traffic to the known C2 IP 45.155.69.25.
```
title: Outbound Traffic to 45.155.69.25
logsource:
  category: proxy
detection:
  selection:
    dst_ip: "45.155.69.25"
condition: selection
level: critical
```

---

## Memory & Crypto Layer

### RWX Memory Allocation
Houselet allocates memory with Read/Write/Execute permissions for in-memory payloads. This rule detects RWX allocations.
```
title: RWX Memory Allocation by Go Binary
logsource:
  category: sysmon
detection:
  selection:
    CallTrace|contains: "VirtualAlloc"
condition: selection
level: high
```

### Use of Cryptographic Functions
The malware uses AES, RC4, and Base64 for obfuscation. This rule detects suspicious crypto API calls.
```
title: Suspicious Crypto API Usage
logsource:
  category: sysmon
detection:
  selection:
    CallTrace|contains:
      - "CryptEncrypt"
      - "CryptAcquireContext"
      - "BCryptEncrypt"
condition: selection
level: medium
```

## Evasion & Impersonation Layer

### Fake Sony Metadata
Houselet pretends to be a Sony installer. This rule detects binaries with Sony metadata but unsigned/self-signed certificates.
```
title: Fake Sony Metadata
logsource:
  category: file
detection:
  selection:
    file.description|contains: "Sony Interactive Entertainment"
    signature.status: "Untrusted"
condition: selection
level: medium
```

### Anti-VM Checks
The malware performs anti-VM checks. This rule detects suspicious registry or process queries typical of VM detection.
```
title: Anti-VM Behavior
logsource:
  category: sysmon
detection:
  selection:
    Image|contains: "houselet.exe"
    CommandLine|contains:
      - "VBoxService"
      - "vmtoolsd"
      - "qemu"
condition: selection
level: medium
```

## Summary
These detection rules cover:
- Execution from Temp and self-spawning behavior  
- Registry persistence via IE ZoneMap and proxy keys  
- Network beaconing to PHP endpoints and known C2 IP  
- Memory allocation with RWX permissions and suspicious crypto usage  
- Evasion tactics like fake Sony metadata and anti-VM checks
